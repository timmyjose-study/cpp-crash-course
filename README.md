# cpp-crash-course

Learning C++ (fast-forwarded) using this [repo](https://github.com/rougier/CPP-Crash-Course#foreword) as well as this [one](https://github.com/changkun/modern-cpp-tutorial). 
The primary aim is to learn enough "proper" C++ so as to be able to work with LLVM for Project Oyi (and beyond).
